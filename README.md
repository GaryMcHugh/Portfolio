### Summary:
This is a Portfolio Website that I have created for myself to showcase my Web Development abilities and provide a medium for potential employers to contact me through. I wrote it through ASP.NET MVC using a bootstrap template for the front-end. The site features some of my work presented through well designed modal's which contain links to view my work on Github. It also contains a short summary about me and a CV download function. Finally, there is a contact form at the bottom of the page which is used to get in contact with me through my email.
